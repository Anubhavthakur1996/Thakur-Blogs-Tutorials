## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

Someone I know asked me to teach him about computer and possibly programming. Since, I started teaching him, I realised not all people are familiar with computers and technology as the modern generation or people from tech industry are. Thus, I decided to make this app to publish tutorials and guides for him and people like him.
